old stuff
--------

General plan and thoughts, most of the first part is in place, thoughts at the end are not

Future thoughts and todos:
--------------------------

monitor for changes on devel branch, auto merge to master after full test suite has passed, make commite message wih the results, incrament the build number in the changelog on the devel branch after merging to master
  No.... not going to mess with merging, only going to build off of master, should do some kind of test to make sure the version incremented, otherwise packrat won't take the new files

set git tag when packages are built

dependancies:
  dependancie comes from packrat package-name
  prefixed with ci/dev to know what version to look at

Testing ordering:
  order by projects from fewest dependancies to the most
