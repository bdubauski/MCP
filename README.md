To debug this code you can use VS Code IDE:

1. Navigate to 'MCP' folder and start local web server:
        python3 -m http.server
2. Load MCP folder into your VS Code workspace (File | Add Folder to Workspace...)
3. Click on Run | Start Debugging menu in VS Code
4. Set a breakpoint in .js file if needed - execution will pause there and vars can be inspected, etc.
